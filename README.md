# FrinkleApp

This is an an app created for people to meet new friends, find love and begin a relationship.

I decided to do a project where I hosted a web application on Azure App Service.
For version control, I used GitHub.

**Project Overview:**

**Phase 1**: Version Control with GitHub
I created a new repository, initialized using Git Bash, staged, committed and pushed the code to the new GitHub repository.

**Phase 2**: Azure App Service Setup
I used Azure CLI to create a Resource Group, App Service Plan and Azure Web App.

**Phase 3**: Deployment
I deployed the web application from GitHub to Azure using Azure CLI and tested the deployment by accessing the application URL.

The web application is called FrickleApp and it is a site where people who are looking for love or to start a relationship sign up to.
